Peak measured workloads; text pp is autoregressive (AR), while tg uses the
named speculative mode. Peaks include repetitive output; aggregate tg sums
individual request decode rates. Qwen27B's single-user peak uses the short-prompt
C1 workload. Audio excludes loading.
Each model guide lists the required files and complete benchmark settings.

## Philosophy

- Contributions are welcome! We need the help of Strix Halo community to keep improving gufo!
- We would like this to be the one-stop shop for Strix Halo Local AI enthusiasts: batteries included for text, audio, image, and video models.
- Build and optimize specifically for the Strix Halo 128 GiB hardware. Smaller memory configurations should still work and preserve the speed benefits for models that can fit on memory.
- Support only the best available models for their size that can run on this hardware: less code to maintain, more focused optimization and testing work.
- Preserve quality when optimizing. Each model's quality report records independent numerical checks, execution consistency and unresolved gaps. Don't reuse kernels across different models to limit blast radius of a code change.
- Treat concurrent requests, cancellation and conversation caching as first-class workloads.
- Keep production dependencies small and development tools separate.

Rootless Podman needs `crun` for `--group-add keep-groups`. Your host user must
have read/write access to `/dev/kfd` and `/dev/dri/renderD*`, usually through the
`render` and `video` groups; log out and back in after changing membership.
Container groups named `video`/`render` do not preserve host supplementary
groups. Check `id`, `ls -l /dev/kfd /dev/dri/renderD*`, and
`podman info --format '{{.Host.OCIRuntime.Name}}'` if ROCm reports no device.
See [Podman's rootless group-access guidance](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#20-passed-in-devices-or-files-cant-be-accessed-in-rootless-container).

On Fedora or another SELinux-enforcing host, GPU enumeration can succeed while
SELinux blocks mapping `/dev/kfd`, causing ROCr to report a misleading
“Memory critical” error. Check the **host** audit log:

```sh
sudo ausearch -m avc -ts recent | grep -E '/dev/kfd|hsa_device_t'
```

If it shows a denied `map` for the container, Podman documents this fix:

```sh
sudo setsebool -P container_use_devices true
```

This persistently allows containers to access device labels for devices passed
into them; it affects all containers on that host. Review that policy scope
before enabling it. See [Podman's device documentation](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-run.1.html#device-host-device-container-device-permissions)
and the [SELinux container policy](https://github.com/containers/container-selinux/blob/main/container.te).

Then, from another terminal, ask it something through the OpenAI-compatible API:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen3.8-27B-UD-Q8_K_XL",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say something"}]
  }'
```

For Open WebUI, VS Code and OpenAI SDK clients, set the API base URL to
`http://localhost:8080/v1`. Chat Completions supports text, images, tools and
streaming; Responses supports text and streaming. See the [API contract](docs/SERVER.md).

The text server uses the model's native context by default and generates until
EOS or the context is full. `--context N` sets context capacity per session;
`--max-tokens N` sets a default response limit that clients can override.
Reasoning tokens count toward that response limit.

## Build from source

Linux x86-64 on AMD Strix Halo (`gfx1151`) is the supported target. CMake owns
one production configuration for both Nix and ordinary Linux builds. Tests,
profilers, tuning executables and Python reference runners are not installed
with the production package. No `build.sh` wrapper is needed.

### With Nix

```sh
nix build
./result/bin/gufo diagnose
./result/bin/gufo serve llm --model /path/to/model.gguf
```

[flake.lock](flake.lock) pins the dependencies. `nix develop` adds profiling,
model-download and independent evaluation tools; these are not runtime
requirements. Optional benchmark baselines are selected separately with
`nix shell .#ds4-reference`, `.#llama-cpp-reference` or
`.#llama-cpp-mtp-reference`; see [benchmarking](docs/BENCHMARKS.md).
See [testing](docs/TESTING.md) for the small hosted CI suite and
explicit local quality checks.

### Without Nix

Install a C++20 compiler, CMake 3.21+, Ninja, pkg-config and the
following development libraries. The currently qualified toolchain is GCC
15.3 and ROCm 7.2.3. Attention and audio convolution kernels are compiled
directly from HIP. Python, Triton/AOTriton, Composable Kernel and MIOpen are
not production build or runtime requirements.

| Dependency | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| ROCm HIP compiler/runtime, hipBLAS, hipBLASLt, rocBLAS | GPU execution and matrix multiplication |
| hipCUB, rocPRIM, rocWMMA headers | Compiled GPU kernels |
| ICU, libcurl, OpenSSL, libpng, libjpeg, libwebp | Tokenization, HTTPS, hashing and images |
| FFmpeg and ffprobe | Video/audio output; invoked as separate executables |

Install ROCm using [AMD's Linux instructions](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/).
Use the development packages for the libraries above. ROCm normally installs
under `/opt/rocm`.

For example, on Debian/Ubuntu the ordinary system libraries are:

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential cmake ninja-build pkg-config \
  libicu-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev libwebp-dev ffmpeg

# ROCm libraries from the table, named as AMD's repository ships them.
sudo apt install hipblas-dev hipblaslt-dev rocblas-dev \
  hipcub-dev rocprim-dev rocwmma-dev

cmake --preset release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/.local"
cmake --build --preset release --parallel 4
./build/release/gufo diagnose
./build/release/gufo serve llm --model /path/to/model.gguf
```

Configuring fails at `find_package(hipblas)` when those ROCm packages are
missing. Other distributions name them `-devel` instead of `-dev`.
For nonstandard installations, pass ordinary CMake paths, for example
`cmake --preset release -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/rocm"`.
If compiler discovery picks a system Clang, also pass
`-DCMAKE_HIP_COMPILER=/opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang++`.
Use `cmake --install build/release` to install Gufo,
its runtime data and license notices. The GPU driver must allow your user to
access `/dev/kfd` and `/dev/dri`; model weights are acquired separately.

The same source, compiler flags and install rules serve both builds. Nix pins
the complete toolchain for reproducible comparisons; changing the compiler or
math libraries requires the affected model's quality checks.

### Debian package

The `debian/` directory builds two packages with `dpkg-buildpackage`:

- `gufo` — the binary, runtime data and license notices.
- `gufo-rocm-repo` — registers the AMD ROCm apt repository and signing key,
  because the ROCm libraries Gufo needs (hipblaslt, rocwmma and the HIP
  runtime) are not available in the Debian or Ubuntu repositories.

Build the packages on a Debian or Ubuntu machine with the ROCm development
packages installed from the AMD repository:

```sh
sudo apt install dpkg-dev debhelper cmake ninja-build pkg-config \
  libicu-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev
# ROCm development packages from the AMD repository (see below).
sudo apt install hipblas-dev hipblaslt-dev rocblas-dev \
  hipcub-dev rocprim-dev rocwmma-dev
dpkg-buildpackage -b
```

This produces `gufo_<version>_amd64.deb` and `gufo-rocm-repo_<version>_all.deb`
in the parent directory. The build host and the target machines must use the
same ROCm source, because the binary records the ROCm library paths at build
time.

On a target machine, install the repository package first, then Gufo. Use
`tools/deploy/install-gufo-deb.sh` from the directory containing the `.deb`
files; it installs with `--no-install-recommends` so the AMD ROCm runtime
packages do not pull their `-dev` counterparts (which would install the ROCm
compiler and the GCC toolchain). Package paths default to `gufo_*.deb` and
`gufo-rocm-repo_*.deb`, so new versions need no script changes:

```sh
scp gufo_*.deb gufo-rocm-repo_*.deb target:~/debs/
ssh target 'cd ~/debs && ./install-gufo-deb.sh'
```

Or manually:

```sh
sudo apt install ./gufo-rocm-repo_*.deb
sudo apt update
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends ./gufo_*.deb
```

The install creates a dedicated `gufo` system user and a `gufo.service`
systemd unit that runs the LLM server from the user's home directory
(`/var/lib/gufo`). The service is **not started on install**: it needs a
model configured first, otherwise it would restart-loop. Configure
`/etc/gufo/gufo.env`, then start it:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now gufo
```

Model weights live in a shared Hugging Face cache at
`/var/lib/huggingface/hub`, owned by the `llm-servers` group, so other
LLM servers on the machine can reuse the same downloads. Download a model
as the `gufo` user and point the service at it:

```sh
sudo -u gufo hf download unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF \
  Qwen3.8-27B-UD-Q8_K_XL.gguf \
  --revision 4ca720788d1e01f1bff70c033e0d0028fd02e502 \
  --repo-type model
sudo sed -i 's|^GUFO_MODEL=.*|GUFO_MODEL=/var/lib/huggingface/hub/models--unsloth--Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF/snapshots/4ca720788d1e01f1bff70c033e0d0028fd02e502/Qwen3.8-27B-UD-Q8_K_XL.gguf|' \
  /etc/gufo/gufo.env
sudo systemctl restart gufo
```

After changing `/etc/gufo/gufo.env` or a unit drop-in, run
`sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart gufo` (a plain
restart alone keeps the previously loaded unit configuration).

The service listens on port 8080; check it with `systemctl status gufo` and
`journalctl -u gufo`. The target machine needs an AMD Strix Halo GPU
(`gfx1151`), the amdgpu kernel driver with gfx1151 support, and read/write
access to `/dev/kfd` and `/dev/dri` for the `gufo` user (the package adds it
to the `video` and `render` groups). Model weights are acquired separately.

### Speculative decoding (MTP) and context size

The packaged unit serves the model with its native context (262144 for
Qwen3.8 Flash-Next) and no speculative decoding. To enable MTP or cap the
context, add a systemd drop-in (machine-specific configuration, survives
package upgrades):

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/gufo.service.d
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/gufo.service.d/mtp.conf > /dev/null <<'EOF'
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/gufo serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 llm --model ${GUFO_MODEL} --speculative mtp --mtp-model ${GUFO_MTP_MODEL} --sessions 2 --context 131072
EOF
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart gufo
```

Set `GUFO_MTP_MODEL` in `/etc/gufo/gufo.env` to the MTP draft GGUF path
inside the cache. See the model's `docs/models/<model>/README.md` for the
supported speculative modes and context limits.

To let another LLM server on the machine share the cache, add its service
user to the `llm-servers` group (the cache directory is setgid, so new
downloads inherit the group):

```sh
sudo usermod -a -G llm-servers lemonade
sudo systemctl restart lemond
```

To reuse an existing cache instead of downloading again, point
`HF_HUB_CACHE` in `/etc/gufo/gufo.env` at it (for example lemonade's
`/opt/var/lib/lemonade/.cache/huggingface/hub`) and give the `gufo` user
read access to those directories. The cache survives `apt purge gufo`.

To copy the model cache to another machine instead of downloading there,
use `tools/deploy/sync-model-cache.sh` (transfers with root on both
sides, fixes ownership to `gufo:llm-servers` and the setgid bit):

```sh
./tools/deploy/sync-model-cache.sh dsiadmin@ia-prod04
```

Never remove the ROCm `-dev` packages with apt on a machine that also has
xrt or dkms installed: AMD's dependency graph is entangled and removal
cascades into unrelated packages (including the Gufo runtime itself).
